Array is a kind of data structure.
Array is a collection of data or values of same data type.
Values inside an array are stored in continuous memory locations.
EX: int arr[5]={1,2,3,4,5};
	Here size of the array is 5, means it can store upto 5 integer values
	and index start from 0 to 5-1=4.

Passing An Array As an Argument to a Function:
Array follow PASS BY REFERENCE CONCEPT only. 
Changes made inside a user defined function would affect the original array
as we need to pass the address of the array while passing it as an argument 
to a function.

To pass address of the array, name of the array is enough.
To store the base address we need to use a pointer.
Pointer:
	int *ptr;
	ptr = arr;
here *ptr == ptr[];

*ptr == arr[0];

to print values of the array we can use the following method.

void printArray(int *ptr)
{
	for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
	{
		printf("%d ",*(ptr+i));
	}

}

void printArray(int b[])
{
	for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
	{
		printf("%d ",b[i]);  // b[] == *b, b[i]== *(b+i);
	}

}
